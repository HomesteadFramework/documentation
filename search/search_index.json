What is Homestead Homestead is being developed to help developers scaffold and create applications using best in class Python packages. We are trying to solve the problem of having to setup the basic architecture of a Python web application. We know everyone loves FastAPI but setting up a new project can be a pain. You need to setup the folder structure, setup a database connection and a list of other things. Using Homesteads craft command you can scaffold a new project with one cli command and get coding fast. How about setting up a new endpoint? Homestead is opinionated on how a project is setup and as long as you adhere to the structure defined you can use craft to create new modules which will contain a controller. Just choose if you want an api or web controller and we will create a controller that returns a json response or a template using Jinja2 and fastapi-jinja .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#homestead","text":"Homestead is pre-alpha and still in active development.","title":"Homestead"},{"location":"#what-is-homestead","text":"Homestead is being developed to help developers scaffold and create applications using best in class Python packages.

Since homestead is built on top of FastAPI it is possible to use anything from FastAPI, however, there are certain things that we have overloaded to make FastAPI work better as an app building platform than just an api. The base app When developing an app with FastAPI you will have to import FastAPI and create an app. The same is true for Homestead. However, your app will import Homestead and create a Homestead app. from homestead import Homestead app = Homestead() Routing Homestead uses FastAPI's routing system to handle requests. We have decided that every route must be contained within a router to make it possible to automatically import all of your routes for you. This means any router you create will automatically be registered with the app. Since Homestead is aimed at building apps as well as APIs we created a new router called WebRouter which is a clone of FastAPI's APIRouter but it overwrites the include_in_schema to be false. This means the routes will not be included in the OpenAPI schema.","title":"Homestead Core"},{"location":"features/core/#homestead-core","text":"","title":"Homestead Core"},{"location":"features/core/#introduction","text":"Homestead core is a collection of packages and modules that are used to build an app with Homestead.

We will Homestead's cli craft . Create a new directory where you want to create your project and cd into it. Then run craft project init mkdir ~/projects/homestead_project cd ~/projects/homestead_project craft project init Setting Up Your Virtual Environment Homestead comes with both a pyproject.toml and a requirements.txt file. This will allow you to create a virtual environment anywhere you want. Creating a Virtual Environment With Poetry Make sure you are in the root directory of your project. poetry install This will create a poetry virtual environment.
